I use statistical models to study why fish populations fluctuate in abundance and distribution. I'm particularly interested in research that impacts the management of wild fisheries.

Some topics I have worked on:

- Stock assessment methods
- Spatio-temporal modelling of fish distributions
- Ecological forecasting
- State-space models
- Time series analysis

A list of my publications can be found in my [CV](https://github.com/perretti/site/blob/master/static/cv_pdf/perretti_cv.pdf) and on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U6llh8UAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).
