I use statistical models to study why fish populations fluctuate in abundance and distribution. I am particularly interested in research that impacts the management of wild fisheries.

Some topics I have worked on:

- Spatio-temporal modelling of fish distributions
- Stock assessment methods
- Ecological forecasting
- State-space models
- Time series analysis

A list of my publications can be found in my [CV](https://github.com/perretti/site/).
