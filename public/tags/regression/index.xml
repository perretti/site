      <description>Predicting a categorical response is a fairly common task in ecology. For example, we might want to predict which species will colonize a particular habitat given some characteristics of the habitat. Or which species an individual belongs to based on some body mesurements. The underlying goal is to construct a model that relates a set of measured covariates to a categorical outcome. Often we would like to also know the probability that each outcome will occur, rather than just the most likely outcome.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of the central assumptions of the linear regression is that the residuals are uncorrelated. Unfortunately, this assumption is often violated in real data. As we’ll see, ignoring this can lead to incorrect inferences, primarily through overconfident estimates. Here I’ll demonstrate how to fit a linear regression that accounts for correlated residuals, and how the results differ from that of a linear regression without correlated residuals (which I’ll call a “simple linear regression”).</description>
