      <description>Predicting a categorical response is a fairly common task in ecology. For example, we might want to predict which species will colonize a particular habitat given some characteristics of the habitat. Or which species an individual belongs to based on some body mesurements. The underlying goal is to construct a model that relates a set of measured covariates to a categorical outcome. Often we would like to also know the probability that each outcome will occur, rather than just the most likely outcome.</description>
