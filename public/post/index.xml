      <description>Introduction One of the central assumptions of the linear regression is that the residuals are uncorrelated. Unfortunately, this assumption is often violated in real data. As we’ll see, ignoring this can lead to incorrect inferences, primarily through overconfident estimates. Here I’ll demonstrate how to fit a linear regression that accounts for correlated residuals, and how the results differ from that of a linear regression without correlated residuals (which I’ll call a “simple linear regression”).</description>

      <description>Introduction When working with time series we often run into the problem of missing observations. Here I’ll walk through how to estimate missing observations and their uncertainties using a state-space model in R using Template Model Builder (TMB).
I’ll use a random-walk state-space model (also known as a Kalman Filter) to estimate missing values, so let’s start off by describing that model. Every state-space model is composed of a two parts: (1) a process model and (2) an observation model.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is an example of how to fit a simple hierarchical model in R using Template Model Builder (TMB). I’ll describe why you might want to use a hierarchical model, then I’ll show how to code it up and fit it in TMB. I won’t go too deep into the mechanics of TMB (full documentation can be found here), instead I’ll focus on introducing the idea of hierarchical modelling and how to fit one such model in TMB.</description>
